Description: A simple dns proxy to tunnel DNS requests over a socks proxy (for example, over ssh or Tor). This can come in handy when setting up transparent proxies.
It chooses a random DNS server for each request from the file "resolv.conf" which is a newline delimited list of DNS servers.
The daemon must be run as root in order for it to bind to port 53.
